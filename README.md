## Description

Counters such as 74ls93 are sequential circuits which can be designed with JK flip-flops and simulated using the Quartus application. These sequential circuits
go through a defined sequence of states upon the application of input impulses.

## Usage
Run the applications and provide any relevant information as you click through the app and interact with it.




  
### Note
- The AI Python API response time is not as quick as the actual ChatGPT application
- It can take 10 - 60 seconds or more depending on the length/number of tokens of text sent to it
- Not all the buttons are functional, the demo shows those that work
